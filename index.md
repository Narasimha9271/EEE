# EEE Interview Preparation Guide

This guide covers essential concepts for Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) interviews, providing in-depth explanations and potential tricky questions.

## 1. Basic Electrical Concepts

### Key Concepts:

-   Ohm's Law
-   Kirchhoff’s Laws
-   AC vs. DC Circuits
-   Electrical Power and Energy
-   Series and Parallel Circuits

### In-Depth Explanation:

-   **Ohm's Law:** \( V = IR \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current, and \( R \) is resistance.
-   **Kirchhoff's Laws:**
    -   **KCL (Kirchhoff’s Current Law):** The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving the junction.
    -   **KVL (Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law):** The sum of all voltages around a closed loop equals zero.
-   **AC vs. DC Circuits:** Understand RMS values, phase difference, and power factor.
-   **Electrical Power and Energy:** Power (\( P \)) = Voltage (\( V \)) × Current (\( I \)). Energy (\( E \)) = Power (\( P \)) × Time (\( t \)).
-   **Series and Parallel Circuits:** Calculations of equivalent resistance, voltage drops, and current distribution.
