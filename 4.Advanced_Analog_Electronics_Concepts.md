## Potential Tricky Questions and Answers:

1. **Q:** How would you design a basic low-pass filter using an op-amp and passive components?
   **A:** Use a resistor and capacitor in series with the input signal and connect this to the inverting terminal of an op-amp. The non-inverting terminal is grounded. The output is taken from the op-amp output terminal.

2. **Q:** Explain the working principle and applications of a transistor in the saturation region.
   **A:** In the saturation region, both the base-emitter and base-collector junctions of a BJT are forward biased. The transistor acts as a closed switch, allowing maximum current flow from collector to emitter. It is used in switching applications, such as turning on/off loads.

3. **Q:** How does a Zener diode regulate voltage in a circuit?
   **A:** A Zener diode is placed in reverse bias across the load. When the input voltage exceeds the Zener breakdown voltage, the diode conducts and maintains a constant output voltage equal to the Zener breakdown voltage.

4. **Q:** Describe the main differences between a BJT and a MOSFET.
   **A:** A BJT is a current-controlled device with low input impedance, suitable for low-frequency applications. A MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device with high input impedance, suitable for high-frequency applications and efficient switching.
